# Exploratory-data-analysis-for-Real-Data-Science-course-of-SkillFactory
Description  

It is a training task:
“We need to find out the influence of living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their academic performance in mathematics in order to identify students at risk at an early stage.
To do this, a model will be created that predicts the results of the exam in mathematics for each student.”

My task is 
to perform exploratory data analysis to determine the parameters of the future model.

My additional task:
Based on the training project, compile an initial version of the Exploratory Data Analysis manual to use in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to make EDA as complete as possible, even if for this specific task it will be overmuch.
